# Automated Testing Kit D7

Automated Testing Kit D7 (ATK) is a suite of tests and useful functions for end-to-end
testing using Cypress and Playwright specifically for Drupal 7 sites. ATK for
Drupal 10+ website is located at https://www.drupal.org/project/automated_testing_kit.
ATK D7 has tests for Playwright (but not Cypress).

Like the original project, this projects has tests for:
- basic login/logout via the UI
- registration and confirmation of the email via a fake SMTP service (ethereal.email)
- integration of the QA Accounts module
- basic tests of node, taxonomy, media and user entities.
- executing Drush commands via aliases or to Pantheon via Terminus and ssh
- much more

ATK works in the following environments:
- on the native OS (i.e. macOS/Linux)
- native OS + a container (via DDEV/Lando/Docksal)
- within a container.

Use Docker images provided by the Playwright team
[Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker)).

## Requirements

Install on a recent version of Drupal 7.

This module requires Playwright to be installed plus the browsers you
will test on (all of which can be in containers). See the Playwright project for
installation instructions.

The module has several dependencies, which are listed in [the documentation](https://performantlabs.com/automated-testing-kit-d7/requirements).


## Recommended modules

Some tests require additional modules to be installed. If you don't want to use those
tests, comment them out and don't add the module[s] below to your project.
The documentation lists the modules a test requires.

Here are the dependencies currently:

- [Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform)
- [QA Accounts](https://www.drupal.org/project/qa_accounts)
- [Symfony Mailer](https://www.drupal.org/project/symfony_mailer)
- [XML Sitemap](https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap)


## Installation

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.
 * Read the ATK D7 documentation. Move the tests to your project
   with the atk_setup script, set up the target URL and further customize the Kit for
   your Drupal installation.


## Configuration

Refer to the [documentation](https://performantlabs.com/automated-testing-kit-d7/requirements);
you will need to set the target URL and a few more items.

Automated Testing Kit D7 has a configuration page located at
/admin/config/development/automated_testing_kit/edit (stub for now).


## FAQ

**Q: I'm just starting. Which testing framework should I use, Cypress or Playwright or
something else?**

**A:** Automated Testing Kit D7 currently has tests just for Playwright. To learn about
the difference between Cypress and Playwright, you'll find many videos and blog posts
comparing the tools in the [Learning Resources area of the documentation](https://performantlabs.com/automated-testing-kit/learning-resources).
